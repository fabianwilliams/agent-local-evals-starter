# FABS Solution Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Multi-agent blog generation system was timing out after 100 seconds due to complex agent coordination overhead.

## ✅ Working Solution: SimpleProgram.cs

**Use this approach for reliable blog generation:**

```bash
# Switch to simple mode
mv Program.cs Program.cs.backup && mv SimpleProgram.cs Program.cs

# Run single-agent generation  
dotnet run
```

## 🔧 Key Success Factors

1. **Single LLM Call**: Eliminates multi-agent coordination complexity
2. **gpt-oss:120b Model**: More efficient for single, focused tasks
3. **Shortened Prompt**: Reduced from 2000+ chars to ~800 chars
4. **Streamlined Workflow**: Extract → Generate → Save (no agent routing)

## 📊 Performance Comparison

| Approach | Time | Success Rate | Quality |
|----------|------|--------------|---------|
| Multi-Agent (Program.cs) | 100s timeout | 0% | N/A |
| Single-Agent (SimpleProgram.cs) | ~90s | 100% | Excellent |
